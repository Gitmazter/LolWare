        <p>Meet Uncle Pimpin'</p>
        <p>
          On the 30th of April 1975 a pimp named <em>Nguyen "Cali" Pimpin'</em> faced a massive dilemma.
          He had been serving the soldiers of both the Vietnamese and American armies with the finest bitches Vietnam had to offer. 
          Now that the war was over he would lose his most lucrative source of income and as a result, lose his reputation as the 
          most succesful vietnamese pimp in over a century.

            He arranged a cattle car for his ho's and took them all over to Vung Tau where he intended to open
            the greatest brother Vietnam or the World had ever seen.
